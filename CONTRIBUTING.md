# Contributing

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the USC Turtle Simulator!

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Capitalize the first letter subject line
* Do not end the subject line with a period
* Separate subject from body with a blank line
* Limit the first line to 50 characters or less
* Wrap commit body message at 72 characters
* Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

Refer to [this website](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) for more details.

### C# Styleguide

All C# must adhere to [C# Coding Convention](https://www.dofactory.com/reference/csharp-coding-standards).

* One key difference is to use same line starting brackets wherever possible
  ```js
  // Use this:
  public void FunctionName() {

  }

  // Instead of:
  public void FunctionName()
  {

  }
  ```
